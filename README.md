# Personal Passion Project
## Research question
How can we improve the connection between plant and
plant owner, resulting in a better plant care?

## Client
I will focus on (forgetfull) plant owners / enthusiasts

## Core project statement
The intention of this project is to increase the relationship between plant and plant owner.
This will be recieved by giving the plant a more lively feeling to it and turning it into a pet. This will
create an emotional connection between plant and plant owner, resulting in better plant care.
